2. Double-click: C:\Users\Student\Desktop\gqcars\START-EVERYTHING.bat
3. Open Cursor to the gqcars folder
4. Make a small change in Cursor - watch it sync to Desktop Claude!
```

### **2. Verify MCP Connection:**
- âœ… Website running at http://localhost:3000
- âœ… Orange WhatsApp widget (we already changed this!)
- âœ… MCP sync bridge active
- âœ… File changes being logged

### **3. Test Cross-Platform Sync:**
- Make a change in Cursor â†’ Should appear in sync logs
- Make a change via Desktop Claude â†’ Should sync to Cursor
- Both Claudes should maintain full project context

## ðŸ”® FUTURE WORKFLOW:

### **Daily Routine:**
1. **Start**: Double-click `START-EVERYTHING.bat` 
2. **Develop**: Use both Claude Desktop and Cursor seamlessly
3. **Deploy**: MCP handles Git commits and deployment
