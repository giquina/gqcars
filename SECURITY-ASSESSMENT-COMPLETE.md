The recommendation engine uses a weighted scoring system:

scores = {
  standard: 0,    // GQ Standard Service
  executive: 0,   // GQ Executive Service  
  xl: 0          // GQ XL Service
}
```

### Question Weights
- **Purpose**: Corporate/Personal → Executive, Events → XL, Airport → Standard
- **Passengers**: Single/Couple → Executive, Groups → XL, Large Groups → XL only
- **Security Level**: Standard → Standard, Enhanced/Executive → Executive, VIP → Executive
- **Distance**: Local → Standard, Regional → Executive, Long Distance → Executive
- **Frequency**: Occasional → Standard, Regular/Frequent → Executive

### Service Recommendations
1. **GQ Standard** (£6.50/mile): Professional taxi with SIA security driver
2. **GQ Executive** (£10.50/mile): Premium luxury with elite CPO drivers  
3. **GQ XL** (£7.20/mile): Large group vehicles for 5-8 passengers
