## 🔄 **MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED** (You Must Do)

### **🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS**

#### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd apps/web
rm -rf node_modules
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
**Issue:** WSL I/O conflicts preventing installation

#### **2. Test Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Expected:** Website on `http://localhost:3000`

#### **3. Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add production optimizations and deployment features"
git push origin main
```
**Requires:** Your GitHub authentication

#### **4. Vercel Deployment**
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set root directory to `apps/web`
3. Add environment variables from `.env.example`
4. Deploy

### **🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - POST-DEPLOYMENT**

#### **5. Service Configurations**
- **Google Analytics**: Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
- **SendGrid**: Add `SENDGRID_API_KEY` for emails
- **Stripe**: Configure webhooks with live site URL
- **Custom Domain**: Add `gqsecurity.co.uk` in Vercel
