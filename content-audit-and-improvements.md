## 5. ENHANCED CALL-TO-ACTIONS

### Improved CTA Strategy

**Current CTAs Analysis:**
- "Book Now" - Generic, no urgency
- "Our Services" - Informational, not action-oriented
- "Call Now" - Good but needs enhancement
- "Request Quote" - Decent but could be stronger

**Improved CTAs:**

1. **Primary CTA (Hero):** "Get Your Free Security Assessment"
   - Creates value proposition
   - Low commitment entry point
   - Professional positioning

2. **Secondary CTA (Hero):** "View Our Certifications"
   - Builds trust before conversion
   - Educational approach
   - Supports decision-making

3. **Service CTAs:** "Schedule Consultation"
   - Professional terminology
   - Suggests personalized approach
   - Higher value perception

4. **Emergency CTA:** "24/7 Emergency Response"
   - Highlights immediate availability
   - Critical for security services
   - Clear value proposition

5. **Footer CTA:** "Request Your Confidential Quote"
   - Emphasizes discretion
   - Professional language
   - Clear next step

### CTA Button Improvements
```css
/* Enhanced CTA styling for better conversion */
.cta-primary {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2563eb 0%, #d97706 100%);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.3);
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

}
```
