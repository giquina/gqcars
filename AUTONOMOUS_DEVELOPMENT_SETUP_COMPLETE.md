## ðŸš€ **HOW TO START YOUR AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT:**

### **Option A: Start Custom Agent System**
```bash
cd .agents
npm run dev
```
**Dashboard**: http://localhost:3002

### **Option B: Start Official Claudia (When Ready)**
```bash
cd claudia-official
# Build requires Rust + Bun (instructions in README.md)
```

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
1. Use **Claudia** for project management and session control
2. Use **Custom Agents** for 24/7 autonomous development
3. Monitor progress via the dashboard
