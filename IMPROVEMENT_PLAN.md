# üöÄ GQ Cars Website/App Experience Enhancement Plan

**Purpose:** Transform the GQ Cars website into a high-conversion, app-like experience that instantly communicates its private hire/ride-booking focus, encourages bookings, and feels modern, premium, and interactive. This plan is designed for delegation to individual background agents or devs, and includes the return of the hamburger menu for mobile.

## 1. Instantly Communicate "Book a Ride" Focus

- **Hero Section Overhaul**
  - Add a prominent animated tagline:  
    _"Book Your Secure Ride Instantly ‚Äì SIA Licensed Drivers, 24/7"_
  - Use a large, animated booking form directly in the hero (not below the fold).
  - Add a "How it Works" 3-step visual (Book ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Arrive) with icons.
  - Add a "Download Our App" badge (Apple/Google) with animation.
  - Add a "See Live Rides" ticker (real-time bookings, drivers online).
