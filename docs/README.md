npm run test                # Run all unit tests
npm run test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e            # Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui         # Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:headed     # Run E2E tests in headed mode
