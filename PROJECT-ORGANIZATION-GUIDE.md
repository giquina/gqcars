# 🗂️ GQ CARS PROJECT ORGANIZATION GUIDE

## 📍 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**Your MAIN project location is now:**
```
C:\Users\Student\Desktop\gqcars-frontend
```

## 🎯 WHY THIS ORGANIZATION?

1. **Cursor IDE Integration**: All your Cursor changes save directly here
2. **Localhost:3000**: Your website runs from this location
3. **Git Repository**: All version control is here
4. **No More Confusion**: One place for everything
