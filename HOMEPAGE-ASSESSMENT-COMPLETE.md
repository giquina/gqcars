## âœ… **Homepage Security Assessment - COMPLETE!**

I've successfully transformed the homepage Security Assessment section into an interactive, professional feature that aligns with your "Know Your Client" requirements.

### **Key Improvements:**

1.  **Interactive First Question:**
    *   The "Start Security Assessment" button has been **removed**.
    *   The **first question** of the assessment is now displayed **directly on the homepage**.
    *   Users can begin the assessment immediately by choosing an option, streamlining the process.

2.  **Professional "Know Your Client" Copy:**
    *   The text has been updated to reflect **SIA-compliant** security protocols.
    *   Headings like "Begin Your Security Profile" and "SIA-Compliant Security Assessment" establish a professional tone.

3.  **Seamless User Flow:**
    *   When a user selects an answer on the homepage, they are **automatically redirected** to the full assessment page to continue.
    *   This creates a smooth and engaging user experience.

### **What to Check:**

*   **Visit your homepage:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
*   **Interact with the new section:** You will see the first question ("What is the primary purpose of your trip?") with four clickable options.
*   **Click an option:** You will be taken to the `/assessment` page to complete the rest of the questions.

This new implementation not only looks more professional but also reduces user friction, encouraging more visitors to engage with the assessment and receive their personalized security recommendations.
