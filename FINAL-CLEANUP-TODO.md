## üìä **PROGRESS TRACKING**

### **Phase 1: Complete System Survey & MCP Protection**
- [ ] Survey Development_Projects folder (detailed inventory)
- [ ] Survey entire C:\Users\Student\ directory structure
- [ ] Locate and document ALL MCP-related files
- [ ] Mark ALL MCP files as PROTECTED (never delete/move)
- [ ] Identify obvious junk folders (temp, cache, old downloads)
- [ ] Check disk space usage by folder
- [ ] Create comprehensive cleanup plan with MCP exclusions

### **Phase 2: Development_Projects Cleanup & Directory Consolidation**
- [ ] Verify current GitHub remote points to: https://github.com/giquina/gqcars.git
- [ ] Verify MCP files are in gqcars-main-production and mark as protected
- [ ] Review each other directory in Development_Projects for important content
- [ ] Check for conflicting directories (old gqcars/, duplicates, backups)
- [ ] Preserve important content from non-main directories  
- [ ] **RENAME: gqcars-main-production ‚Üí gqcars** (preserving ALL MCP files)
- [ ] Delete confirmed junk directories (NEVER touching MCP files)
- [ ] Verify ONLY ONE directory remains: Development_Projects\gqcars\
- [ ] Verify git remote still works after rename
- [ ] Confirm local directory name matches GitHub repo name

### **Phase 3: System-Wide Safe Cleanup (MCP-Aware)**
- [ ] Clean Downloads folder (old files, installers, duplicates)
- [ ] Clean Desktop (organize files, remove broken shortcuts)
- [ ] Clean Documents (remove old/duplicate files, organize important ones)
- [ ] Clean temporary files and cache (AVOIDING any MCP-related cache)
- [ ] Remove old application folders (CHECKING for MCP dependencies first)
- [ ] Remove duplicate files (EXCLUDING any MCP files from deduplication)

### **Phase 4: Project Consolidation & MCP Verification**
- [ ] Create git commit checkpoint in main project
- [ ] Update internal file references to new structure
- [ ] VERIFY all MCP files still in correct locations
- [ ] TEST MCP functionality still works
- [ ] Verify development server still works

### **Phase 5: Enhanced CLAUDE.md Automation Setup**
- [ ] Verify current CLAUDE.md contains enhanced 10-rule workflow
- [ ] Use current enhanced CLAUDE.md as master template (preserve all 4 phases)
- [ ] Set up git templates with enhanced workflow for automatic inclusion
- [ ] Create new-project script that generates enhanced CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Verify automation preserves all critical principles and safety rules
- [ ] Test new-project command creates projects with full enhanced workflow

### **Phase 6: Final Verification & Testing**
- [ ] Test development server: npm run dev works
- [ ] Test git operations work correctly
- [ ] TEST MCP functionality completely
- [ ] Test new-project automation works
- [ ] Verify all MCP files intact and functional
- [ ] Document final space saved

## üóëÔ∏è **ENHANCED CLEANUP GUIDELINES WITH MCP PROTECTION**

### **ALWAYS SAFE TO DELETE (after review, excluding MCP):**
- Old installer files (.exe, .msi in Downloads) - CHECK: not MCP-related
- Browser cache folders (if very large) - CHECK: not MCP-related
- Temporary files in %TEMP% - CHECK: no MCP files
- Old log files (.log) - CHECK: not MCP logs
- Duplicate downloads - CHECK: not MCP-related duplicates
- Broken shortcuts on Desktop - CHECK: not pointing to MCP tools
- Empty folders - CHECK: not MCP directories
- Old backup files (.bak, .old) - CHECK: not MCP backups

### **MCP-PROTECTED (NEVER DELETE/MOVE):**
- ANY file with "mcp" in name (case insensitive)
- ANY directory with "mcp" in name
- .claude/ directory and contents
- .agents/ directory and contents
- Any configuration files that might affect MCP
- Any automation scripts related to MCP

### **REVIEW EXTRA CAREFULLY (MCP Dependencies):**
- Any development tool configurations
- Node.js related files (could affect MCP)
- Python files or environments (could affect MCP)
- Any CLI tools or automation scripts
- VS Code / Cursor configurations
- Git configurations and hooks

## üö® **CRITICAL MCP SAFETY RULES**

1. **MCP FILES ARE SACRED** - Never delete, move, or modify any MCP-related file
2. **VERIFY BEFORE EVERY ACTION** - Check if any file/folder affects MCP before touching
3. **TEST MCP AFTER MAJOR CHANGES** - Verify MCP functionality after each phase
4. **WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T DELETE** - If uncertain about MCP impact, leave it alone
5. **DOCUMENT MCP LOCATIONS** - Track where every MCP file is located
6. **ROLLBACK READY** - Have git commits and backups before MCP-adjacent changes
7. **MCP FUNCTIONALITY TEST** - Must verify MCP works after final cleanup

## üìù **MCP FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION**

- [ ] MCP automation scripts run correctly
- [ ] MCP lab tools function properly
- [ ] Claude integration works with MCP
- [ ] All MCP configurations load correctly
